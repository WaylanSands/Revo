# Revo
Revo - Reverse Video, is an iOS app (in progress) that allows users to record seamless video while switching between the front and rear-facing cameras. Revo does this by utilising AVFoundation's AVCaptureMultiCamSession, a capture session that supports simultaneous capture from multiple inputs of the same media type. This app is currently only supported on devices XS, XS Max, XR and later running on iOS 14.
